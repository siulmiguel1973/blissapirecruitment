bliss api

to run this api i use visual studio. you can then call the endpoint using yourlocalhost/api/... but if you prefer you can do the deployment to your iis server ( i didn't test this part ).
my visual studio was the 2017 version with sql server 2016. to respect mock's url format i didn't use OData, that would be more suitable to use filter, offset and limit in "list all questions" endpoint.

about the endpoint's "share" you need to configure your email box in the code, and you need to configure also your query string of your sql server.

i think i understand what was asked to do and i've responded to all requirements of the api.
